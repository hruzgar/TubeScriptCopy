There is millions of youtube videos. But humans only have a finite lifetime. 

Sometimes we watch videos not for pure entertainment, but only to get the some information out of it. 

ChatGPT and other tools are very good at helping you out at moments like this. But they still need the transcript of the video.

To get the transcript of a video manually, you have to click the video description, then "show transcript", select the full transcript with your mouse or with shift and then CTRL + C.

**But no more!**

This userscript will do that all for you automatically with the click of a button!

After installing the script, after a youtube video is loaded, you will see a new menu item when you click on "..." named "Copy Transcript". 

And as you might've already guessed, clicking this button will do the rest for you. And all of this open source and running locally in your browser! Isn't that great?

Also I have to give credits to the developer of [this userscript I got inspired from](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/483035-youtube-transcript-copier): Time Eternity

Without this inspiration, I don't know if I would've tried to create something like this even though it was pretty easy. I also don't know if "Time Eternity" is a real name but either way.. Thanks for reading all this and enjoy the script!
